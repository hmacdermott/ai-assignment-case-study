**Section: AI Use Policy**

This course recognizes AI tools as part of the contemporary learning landscape. Rather than blanket permission or prohibition, assignments in this course use **staged AI boundaries** that specify when and how AI can support your learning.

**Three types of AI boundaries you'll encounter:**

**🚫 No AI stages**: Some work must come entirely from your own observation, reading, creation, or experience. AI cannot reconstruct, enhance, or generate this foundational work. These stages protect the authenticity of primary engagement.

**🤝 AI as Co-Intelligence stages**: After forming your own analysis, you may use AI to test interpretations, surface blind spots, or refine arguments. AI helps you think more rigorously but cannot replace your thinking. Specific productive and unproductive uses will be defined for each assignment.

**🛠️ AI as Tool stages**: AI may be required for visualization, design, or communication tasks. You maintain authorship of ideas while using AI for implementation.

**Your responsibility**: Follow the AI boundaries specified for each assignment stage. Violating these boundaries is an academic integrity issue, not because AI use is inherently wrong, but because it circumvents the learning the assignment is designed to produce.

---

### First Day of Class Framing

**What to say**:

"I know many of you have strong feelings about AI—some of you love using it, some are skeptical, some are confused about what's allowed. Here's my approach: I'm not interested in blanket rules because AI isn't one thing. It can be genuinely helpful for some tasks and genuinely harmful for others.

In this class, every assignment will tell you exactly when you can and can't use AI, and more importantly, **why**. The 'why' matters because I want you to develop judgment about when AI enhances your thinking versus when it replaces it.

Here's the pattern you'll see: First, I'll ask you to do something that requires your direct experience or observation—AI can't do this for you because it wasn't there. Then, after you've formed your own interpretation, you can use AI as a thinking partner to test and refine your ideas. Finally, you might use AI as a communication tool.

If you ever wonder why a specific AI boundary exists, ask me. I can explain the pedagogical reasoning, and if you disagree, we can talk about it. But following these boundaries isn't optional—it's how the learning happens."

### Responding to Common Student Questions

**Student: "Why can't I use AI in Stage 1? It would make my writing better."**

**Faculty response**: "I understand the impulse, but here's what would actually happen: AI would smooth over the specific, messy, sometimes awkward details that make your observation valuable. Those rough edges—moments of confusion, surprising details you noticed, things that didn't fit your expectations—that's the raw material for genuine analysis. If AI 'improves' Stage 1, you lose what makes your work worth analyzing in Stage 2. You're not avoiding AI because it's bad; you're avoiding it because you need authentic primary material to work with."

---

**Student: "How will you know if I used AI when I wasn't supposed to?"**

**Faculty response**: "Honestly? Sometimes it's obvious—AI has tells, like unnaturally polished writing disconnected from specific details, or analysis that could apply to anything rather than your specific situation. But here's what matters more: if you use AI in Stage 1, you won't have genuine material to work with in Stage 2. The assignment won't work for you. You'll struggle to write Stage 2 because you'll be trying to analyze something you didn't actually observe or experience. The constraint isn't there to catch cheaters—it's there because without it, you can't do the intellectual work the assignment requires."`,

    workarounds: `### Workaround 1: Using AI to "Remember" What They Observed

**What it looks like**: Student observes an organizational meeting but doesn't take detailed notes. Later, they describe the meeting to ChatGPT and ask it to "help reconstruct" what happened or "fill in details I might have missed."

**Why students do this**: They didn't realize they needed to document thoroughly during the observation, or they think AI is just helping them "remember better."

**The harm**: AI doesn't reconstruct memory—it generates plausible content based on patterns. The student ends up with AI-generated organizational behavior that sounds realistic but didn't actually happen. They lose their specific, authentic observation.

**How to address it**: **Prevention**: In Stage 1 instructions, be explicit: "Take detailed notes during your observation. You cannot use AI later to reconstruct or fill in details you didn't document. If you missed something, acknowledge the gap rather than inventing content."

---

### Workaround 2: Asking AI to Analyze Stage 1 Content Before Forming Their Own Interpretation

**What it looks like**: Student completes Stage 1 authentically, then immediately pastes it into ChatGPT and asks: "Analyze this organizational meeting using concepts from *Same As Ever*" or "What themes emerge from this field observation?"

**Why students do this**: They're overwhelmed by the open-ended nature of interpretation and want guidance on "what it means" before committing to an interpretation.

**The harm**: The student skips the most important cognitive work—wrestling with their observations to form their own interpretation. They end up defending AI's interpretation rather than developing their own analytical thinking.

---

### General Prevention Strategy

**Build in a mid-point check-in**: After Stage 1 is complete but before Stage 2 begins, have a brief conference, peer review, or online check-in where students share their observations. This creates accountability and lets you catch problems early.

**Make the "why" visible**: Students are less likely to circumvent boundaries they understand. Regularly explain why each constraint exists and what learning it protects.

**Create a revision path**: If students realize they violated boundaries, let them revise with a minor penalty. This reduces the incentive to lie and creates a learning opportunity.`,

    adapting: `### Laboratory Reports (Sciences)

**Stage 1: Experimental Work (No AI)** - Students conduct experiments, record observations, collect data. AI cannot generate hypothetical results, "clean up" messy data, or simulate experiments not performed.

**Stage 2: Analysis and Interpretation (AI as Co-Intelligence)** - Students analyze data, identify patterns, connect findings to theory. AI can help with statistical interpretation, suggesting alternative explanations for results, or identifying confounding variables.

**Stage 3: Implications and Further Research (AI as Co-Intelligence)** - Students propose follow-up experiments or explain real-world applications. AI can help identify relevant literature or refine experimental design proposals.

---

### Problem Sets (Mathematics, Physics, Engineering)

**Stage 1: Individual Problem Solving (No AI)** - Students attempt problems using course concepts. AI cannot solve problems, check work, or suggest approaches.

**Stage 2: Solution Refinement (AI as Co-Intelligence)** - After attempting problems independently, students can use AI to check their approach (not their answer), identify conceptual errors, or understand why a method failed.

**Stage 3: Concept Application (AI as Tool)** - Students create new problems or explain concepts to others. AI can help generate visualizations or check that their created problems are solvable.

---

### General Adaptation Principles

1. **Identify the core learning objective**: What skill or thinking do you most want students to develop? Protect that with Stage 1 constraints.

2. **Recognize where AI genuinely helps**: Once students have formed their own thinking, AI can strengthen it through critique, refinement, or helping identify gaps.

3. **Allow AI for implementation**: If the learning goal is insight (not technical execution), AI can support the communication or implementation of that insight.`,

    assessment: `### Stage 1: Authentic Primary Work

**Excellent (A range)** - Work demonstrates direct, unmediated engagement with source material. Includes specific, concrete details that could only come from personal observation/experience. Shows evidence of authentic noticing—including surprising, confusing, or unexpected elements.

**Proficient (B range)** - Work shows genuine engagement with source material. Includes specific details, though may occasionally slip into generalizations. Mostly captures authentic observation with minimal AI-enhanced smoothing.

**Developing (C range)** - Work contains mix of authentic observation and generic or theoretical description. Lacks specific concrete details; could describe many similar situations. May be overly polished for Stage 1 documentation.

**Needs Revision (D/F range)** - Work appears to be AI-generated hypothetical scenario rather than authentic observation. Contains only generic details that could apply to any situation.

---

### Stage 2: Conceptual Interpretation with AI Co-Intelligence

**Excellent (A range)** - Interpretation is clearly grounded in specific Stage 1 observations. Analysis reveals original thinking that connects observations to concepts in novel ways. Shows evidence of using AI to stress-test interpretation. Co-Intelligence Appendix shows sophisticated understanding of where AI helped vs. where human judgment was essential.

**Proficient (B range)** - Interpretation connects Stage 1 observations to conceptual frameworks appropriately. Shows some original analytical thinking with AI support. Makes reasonable claims supported by evidence.

**Developing (C range)** - Interpretation feels somewhat disconnected from specific Stage 1 observations. Analysis may rely heavily on AI-generated insights with insufficient student development.

**Needs Revision (D/F range)** - Interpretation appears to be AI-generated from Stage 1 content with minimal student contribution. Generic analysis that could apply to any situation, not grounded in student's specific observations.`

                            This stage is about developing your own observational instincts. AI can't watch the world
                            for you, and you can't build analytical skills on someone else's observations. You need
                            this unfiltered foundation for everything that comes next.
                        </p>

                        <h4>The Assignment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Pick an organization you can actually observe. Not one you read about—one you can watch
                            in action. Could be your workplace, a sports team, a student organization, a family business,
                            even your friend group planning something complicated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now watch. How do people actually work together? Who talks to whom? Where do decisions get
                            made? What happens when there's conflict or confusion? Write 500-750 words describing exactly
                            what you see. No analysis yet—that's Stage 2. Right now, just capture the reality in front
                            of you.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What Students Have Analyzed</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A golfer breaking down their own swing mechanics and practice habits</li>
                            <li>Communication patterns between doctors and patients in a physical therapy clinic</li>

                        <h4>Why no AI here?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students need unmediated access to their own observations before introducing any analytical
                            framework. If students use AI to "help reconstruct" events or "enhance" descriptions, they
                            lose the authenticity of what they actually noticed in the moment. The goal is to preserve
                            their unique vantage point as someone who was present.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What would break?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If students could use AI in this stage, they'd unconsciously shift from describing what
                            happened to describing what "should" have happened according to organizational theory. AI
                            would smooth over the messy, contradictory, or surprising details that make the observation
                            valuable. Students would lose the raw material that makes their interpretation genuinely
                            grounded.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What surprises emerged?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students often resist this constraint initially, wanting to "write better" with AI's help.
                            But they consistently report that forcing themselves to rely on memory and perception makes
                            them notice different things—small behavioral details, who had actual vs. formal authority,
                            what went unsaid. The constraint creates more observational richness, not less.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Disciplinary connection</h4>
                        <p>
                            In business and organizational analysis, the ability to observe workplace dynamics without
                            immediately jumping to explanation is foundational. Executives and consultants must learn
                            to see what's actually happening in an organization before imposing frameworks. This mirrors
                            ethnographic research methods where observation precedes interpretation.

                            Go back to what you observed in Stage 1. Now apply Morgan Housel's framework—his ideas about
                            why people make the decisions they do, how organizations actually work versus how we think
                            they work, and why smart people do seemingly irrational things.

                            pattern I noticed?" or "What am I missing in my interpretation?" Treat it like a really

                    <PedagogyPanel>
                        <h4>Why allow AI as co-intelligence here?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students have now formed their own interpretation based on what they observed. AI can help them
                            think more rigorously about that interpretation—proposing alternative explanations, checking
                            logical consistency, surfacing factors they might be missing. This is when AI functions as a
                            critical thinking partner, pushing students to defend or refine claims they've already made.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What's the boundary?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The crucial distinction is that students must have formed an interpretation before engaging AI.
                            They can't paste their Stage 1 observations into Claude and ask "analyze this using <em>Same As
                            Ever</em>." That outsources the interpretive work. Instead, students develop their analysis first,
                            then use AI to stress-test it: "I think this reveals short-term thinking, but what if I'm wrong?
                            What alternative explanations might fit?"
                        </p>

                        <h4>What would break?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If students skip forming their own interpretation and go straight to AI, they get generic
                            organizational analysis that could apply to any situation. The insight that comes from their
                            specific observation gets lost. AI is good at pattern-matching to theory, but it can't know
                            what was meaningful about what they witnessed unless they've already done that interpretive work.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Student outcomes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students report that AI helps them see gaps in their logic or consider factors they hadn't
                            weighted properly. The best uses are when students have AI argue against their interpretation—"convince
                            me I'm wrong about this being about risk aversion"—which forces them to either strengthen their
                            case or recognize they need to revise their thinking.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Disciplinary connection</h4>
                        <p>
                            In business analysis, having your reasoning challenged is normal—by colleagues, clients, or data
                            that doesn't fit your model. Learning to use AI as a "smart skeptic" prepares students for
                            real-world analytical work where interpretations must withstand scrutiny.

                            Students must demonstrate that their analysis has practical implications. It's not enough to
                            explain what happened—they need to show how understanding organizational dynamics leads to
                            better design choices. This is where interpretation becomes actionable.

                            the dynamics they identified, considering implementation challenges, or refining the practical
                            details of their proposals.

                            Business students must learn that understanding organizations isn't an academic exercise—it
                            should inform how you design systems, processes, and incentives. This stage ensures analysis
                            leads to application.

                        Students learn to distinguish between their authentic response to a text and critical frameworks
                        imposed afterward. By documenting their actual reading experience before encountering secondary
                        criticism, they develop the foundational skill of close reading—noticing what's on the page before
                        explaining what it means.

                            analysis. AI tools may not be used to generate, reconstruct, summarize, or analyze your reading
                            experience. The journal entries must reflect what you actually noticed while reading, not what AI

                        <p>
                            The reading journal captures something irreplaceable: the student's actual cognitive and emotional
                            journey through a text. This includes confusion, misinterpretation, evolving understanding—the messy
                            reality of meaning-making that happens when a real reader encounters language on the page. AI can't
                            reconstruct this because it never experienced the reading.

                        <h4>What would break?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If students use AI to "improve" their journal entries or "identify important passages," they lose
                            the authenticity of discovery. AI would direct them toward conventional interpretations or canonical
                            "important moments," erasing the unique patterns they noticed organically. The goal is to preserve
                            their genuine encounter with the text.

                            Literary scholars and critics must develop the capacity for sustained, attentive reading before
                            applying theory. The practice of close reading—noticing diction, syntax, imagery, form—precedes
                            interpretation. This mirrors how professional literary criticism works: primary textual engagement
                            before secondary scholarship.

                        <p>
                            Develop a literary argument by applying one critical framework or theoretical lens to interpret your
                            documented reading experience. You must explain what your pivotal moment reveals about how the text
                            creates meaning—through narrative structure, symbolic patterns, historical context, linguistic choices,
                            genre conventions, or reader positioning.

                            multiple frameworks superficially. Strong interpretation moves beyond description to explain why the
                            text makes the literary choices it does and what effects those choices produce.

                        <p>
                            Students have now formed an interpretation grounded in their actual reading experience. AI can help
                            them test that interpretation against alternative readings, fill in contextual knowledge gaps, or refine
                            the precision of their claims. This is particularly valuable in literary studies where multiple valid
                            interpretations exist—AI can propose alternatives that push students to defend or revise their thinking.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What's the boundary?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students must have developed their interpretive framework based on close reading before engaging AI.
                            They can't input passages from the text and ask "what does this symbolize?" That bypasses the interpretive
                            work. Instead, students propose an interpretation first, then use AI to challenge it.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Disciplinary connection</h4>
                        <p>
                            Literary interpretation requires defending readings against competing explanations. Learning to anticipate
                            counterarguments and strengthen claims with precise textual evidence is central to literary scholarship.
                            AI as critical interlocutor prepares students for academic discourse.

                        <p>
                            Connect your literary analysis to contemporary cultural conversations. The goal is to show how your close
                            reading and theoretical interpretation illuminate current debates, social questions, or artistic practices—demonstrating
                            that literary study has stakes beyond the classroom.

                        <p>
                            This is not about finding "modern parallels" or forced relevance. Instead, ask: What does this text help
                            us understand about how language, narrative, or representation works in contexts that matter now? How does
                            your specific reading offer insight into contemporary questions about power, identity, communication, or
                            meaning-making?

                        <p>
                            Students must demonstrate that literary analysis isn't an isolated academic exercise—it's a way of
                            understanding how meaning, power, and representation function everywhere. This stage asks: What can your
                            careful reading of this specific text teach us about the world we live in now?
                        </p>

                        <h4>Student outcomes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students report this is where their literary analysis starts to feel urgent rather than archival. The best
                            outcomes show genuine insight: "I noticed how this text uses ambiguity to resist easy interpretation, and
                            now I see that same strategy in contemporary political rhetoric—here's why it matters that we understand
                            how that works."

                            Literary scholars don't study old texts because they're old—they study them because close attention to how
                            language works reveals patterns that operate everywhere. This stage ensures students understand why literary
                            analysis is a form of cultural literacy, not historical curiosity.

                            Ecological field skills require students to observe natural systems without preconceptions about
                            what "should" be there. If students use AI to identify species from photos or suggest likely
                            interactions, they lose the authentic struggle of observation—learning to distinguish a white oak
                            from a red oak, recognizing bird calls, noticing which insects visit which flowers. These
                            observational skills are foundational to ecological practice.

                            If students use AI-powered species identification apps or ask AI "what organisms are likely in
                            this habitat," they get correct answers without developing observational competence. They also miss
                            surprises—the unexpected species, the interaction that doesn't fit typical patterns—which often
                            become the most interesting material for analysis.

                            Students have now documented real ecosystem patterns through direct observation. AI can help them
                            think more rigorously about the ecological processes explaining those patterns—proposing alternative
                            mechanisms, surfacing species biology they might not know, or identifying research on similar systems.

                            Students must form their own ecological interpretation based on their field data before engaging AI.
                            They can't input their field notes and ask "explain this ecosystem's ecology." That bypasses the
                            interpretive work.

                            is where observation and analysis become applied ecology.

                            outsourced to AI because the knowledge being built is embodied and material. A painter learns about
                            color relationships by mixing and observing paint, not by asking AI for color theory. The constraint
                            protects the authenticity of studio learning.

                            they bypass the creative problem-solving that is the point of studio education. Art students aren't
                            learning to make objects that look good—they're learning to think through materials, discovering
                            ideas that only emerge through sustained engagement with a medium.

                            Professional artists develop a studio practice—a disciplined, iterative process of making and
                            reflecting. Art school teaches this practice, not just technical skills. Students must learn that
                            artistic ideas come through sustained engagement with materials, not inspiration or ideation divorced
                            from making.

                        <p>
                            Analyze your completed work using art historical and critical frameworks. The goal is to situate
                            your piece within larger conversations about how visual art creates meaning, references traditions,
                            or engages contemporary questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your analysis might explore: formal strategies and their effects, relationship to art historical
                            precedents or movements, how the work engages with contemporary artistic conversations, theoretical
                            frameworks that illuminate what the work does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Strong analysis explains how your artistic choices function, not just what they are. Ground your
                            analysis in the specific work you made.

                        <h4>Why allow AI as co-intelligence here?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students have now created original work through studio practice. AI can help them research art
                            historical context, explore theoretical frameworks, and refine their critical language—supporting
                            the intellectual work of contextualizing their practice without replacing the artistic judgment that
                            comes from making the work themselves.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What's the boundary?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Students must form their own analysis through close observation of their work before engaging AI.
                            They can't upload an image and ask "analyze this artwork." That bypasses the critical looking.
                            Instead, students develop an interpretation based on what they made and why, then use AI to deepen
                            context.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Artists must be able to contextualize their practice—understanding how their work relates to art
                            history and contemporary discourse. Gallery talks, artist statements, and grant applications all
                            require this ability. Learning to research context and articulate formal strategies is essential
                            professional skill.

                        <p>
                            Write an artist statement communicating your work to public audiences—gallery visitors, grant
                            reviewers, or exhibition organizers who need to understand your practice and intent.

                        <p>
                            Strong artist statements: explain your artistic concerns and conceptual interests, describe your
                            process and approach to materials, contextualize the work without over-explaining it, use clear
                            language accessible to educated non-specialists, avoid clichés and vague claims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Artist statements are a distinct genre with specific conventions. They're not academic analysis
                            (Stage 2) but professional communication that helps audiences engage with your work thoughtfully.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Refine clarity and concision (artist statements should be 250-350 words)</li>
                            <li>Test whether your statement is accessible to non-specialist readers</li>
                            <li>Identify jargon or unclear phrasing</li>
                            <li>Explore different ways to articulate the same ideas</li>

                            The core content—your artistic intent, your process, your concerns—must be your own. AI helps with

                        <h4>Why allow AI as communication tool here?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Artist statements are professional documents where clarity and concision matter. Many artists struggle
                            with this genre—visual thinkers articulating in words, balancing accessibility with intellectual
                            substance. AI can help refine language and test clarity without replacing the core content, which
                            comes from the student's studio practice and critical analysis.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Why this is different from Stage 1</h4>
                        <p>
                            Stage 1 protected the making—the embodied, material thinking that can't be outsourced. Stage 3 is
                            about professional communication, where the thinking is done and AI serves as an editing partner. The
                            artwork exists. The analysis is complete. Now AI helps communicate that work effectively to audiences.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Disciplinary connection</h4>
                        <p>
                            Professional artists must write statements for exhibitions, grants, residency applications, and
                            portfolio reviews. Learning to articulate practice clearly is essential, and many successful artists
                            work with editors or writing consultants. AI functions similarly—as a communication partner, not an
                            artistic collaborator.
