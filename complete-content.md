### Stage 3 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 3: Contemporary Resonance | 🤝 AI as Co-Intelligence

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Connect your literary analysis to contemporary cultural conversations.** The goal is to show how your close reading and theoretical interpretation illuminate current debates, social questions, or artistic practices—demonstrating that literary study has stakes beyond the classroom.

This is not about finding "modern parallels" or forced relevance. Instead, ask: What does this text help us understand about how language, narrative, or representation works in contexts that matter now? How does your specific reading offer insight into contemporary questions about power, identity, communication, or meaning-making?

**Your contemporary connection must emerge from your Stage 2 interpretation—not replace it.** If your analysis revealed how the text positions readers through narrative voice, explore how contemporary media uses similar positioning strategies. If you identified patterns of resistance through form, consider where you see those formal strategies today.

**AI may be used to:**
- Identify contemporary cultural moments or debates where your literary insights apply
- Test whether your connection is substantive or superficial
- Surface recent scholarship linking this text to current issues
- Refine how you articulate the connection for readers unfamiliar with literary theory

**Deliverable**: 2-3 pages connecting your literary analysis to contemporary cultural relevance, demonstrating why your reading matters beyond the text itself

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why this stage matters**:
Students must demonstrate that literary analysis isn't an isolated academic exercise—it's a way of understanding how meaning, power, and representation function everywhere. This stage asks: What can your careful reading of this specific text teach us about the world we live in now?

**AI's role**:
AI can help students identify contemporary contexts where their literary insights apply, but students must have formed the core interpretive claim in Stage 2 first. The contemporary connection should feel inevitable—a natural extension of what they discovered through close reading—not tacked on.

**What would break?**
If students ask AI "how is this text relevant today?" without having done deep interpretive work first, they get generic statements about universal themes. The power comes from their specific reading revealing something about how texts create effects—which then helps us understand those same mechanisms in contemporary contexts.

**Student outcomes**:
Students report this is where their literary analysis starts to feel urgent rather than archival. The best outcomes show genuine insight: "I noticed how this text uses ambiguity to resist easy interpretation, and now I see that same strategy in contemporary political rhetoric—here's why it matters that we understand how that works."

**Disciplinary connection**:
Literary scholars don't study old texts because they're old—they study them because close attention to how language works reveals patterns that operate everywhere. This stage ensures students understand why literary analysis is a form of cultural literacy, not historical curiosity.

### Metacognitive Component

**Header**: Co-Intelligence Appendix (Required)

**Student Instructions**:
At the end of your paper, include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) addressing:

**Where did AI help you think more precisely about the text or your argument, and where did it misunderstand the literary nuance or complexity you were working with?**

This reflection is evaluated as part of your metacognitive awareness about AI's strengths and limitations in literary interpretation.

---

### Visual Component

**Header**: Visual Synthesis (Optional)

**Student Instructions**:
You may optionally create a visual representation of your reading journey using AI tools like Gemini. This could map:
- The structural or symbolic patterns you traced through the text
- Your interpretive shift from Stage 1 to Stage 2
- How your close reading connects to contemporary contexts

If you include a visual, also include:
- The prompt you used to generate it
- A brief explanation (150-200 words) of what the visual captures that prose analysis cannot

## ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TAB

### Assignment Overview Panel

**Course**: Environmental Science or Ecology Field Course

**Level**: Undergraduate, 200-300 level

**What students create**: An ecological field study documenting observed ecosystem dynamics, analyzing those observations through ecological theory, and proposing evidence-based management interventions.

**Why this assignment matters**: Students learn to distinguish between what they directly observe in nature and the ecological principles they use to explain it. By starting with documented field observations before applying theory, they develop the foundational scientific skill of evidence-based reasoning—seeing what's actually there before interpreting it.

---

### Stage 1 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 1: Field Documentation and Data Collection | 🚫 No AI Permitted

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Select a local ecosystem you can visit repeatedly** (forest plot, stream, wetland, urban green space, shoreline, or campus habitat). Conduct **4-6 field observation sessions** across at least two weeks, visiting at different times of day when possible.

**What to document:**
- **Species inventory**: What organisms are present? (Plants, animals, fungi, evidence of species you don't see directly)
- **Interactions observed**: Pollination, predation, competition, mutualism—any interaction between organisms you personally witness
- **Abiotic conditions**: Weather, water flow, soil moisture, light conditions, temperature, signs of disturbance
- **Spatial patterns**: Where do different species occur? What patterns do you notice in distribution?
- **Changes over time**: What changes between your visits? Seasonal shifts, weather impacts, new species appearing
- **Photographic evidence**: Document site conditions, species, and interactions (photos must be your own)

**This must be your own direct observation.** AI tools may not be used to:
- Identify species from photos (use field guides or expert consultation instead)
- Infer interactions you didn't witness ("probably" or "likely" scenarios)
- Reconstruct missing data between visits
- Suggest what "should" be present based on habitat type

**Why these constraints?** Scientific observation requires distinguishing between what you measured and what you infer. AI fills gaps with plausible ecological patterns, but science depends on documented evidence, not likely scenarios.

**Deliverable**: Field journal with dated entries, species lists, interaction observations, photographs, and documented abiotic conditions (4-5 pages plus photos)

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why no AI here?**
Ecological field skills require students to observe natural systems without preconceptions about what "should" be there. If students use AI to identify species from photos or suggest likely interactions, they lose the authentic struggle of observation—learning to distinguish a white oak from a red oak, recognizing bird calls, noticing which insects visit which flowers. These observational skills are foundational to ecological practice.

**What would break?**
If students use AI-powered species identification apps or ask AI "what organisms are likely in this habitat," they get correct answers without developing observational competence. They also miss surprises—the unexpected species, the interaction that doesn't fit typical patterns—which often become the most interesting material for analysis. AI would smooth over the uncertainty that makes field ecology challenging and real.

**What surprises emerged?**
Students often resist this constraint initially, wanting technological help with identification. But instructors report that forcing students to use traditional field guides or consult experts creates deeper learning. Students remember organisms they struggled to identify. They learn to tolerate ambiguity ("I saw a small brown bird" is honest data when you can't identify it). The constraint makes observation more authentic, not less.

**Disciplinary connection**:
Ecologists must develop natural history knowledge through direct experience with organisms and habitats. Reading about ecosystems is not the same as spending hours watching them function. This mirrors how ecological research actually works—sustained observation in real systems before analysis and interpretation.

---

### Stage 2 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 2: Ecological Analysis and Interpretation | 🤝 AI as Co-Intelligence

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Use ecological principles to explain the patterns and interactions you documented.** Your analysis should move from "what I observed" to "why the ecosystem functions this way."

Apply concepts such as:
- Trophic relationships and energy flow
- Succession and disturbance ecology
- Niche partitioning and resource competition
- Keystone species and ecological interactions
- Ecosystem services and nutrient cycling
- Impacts of abiotic conditions on community structure

**Strong analysis explains causal mechanisms, not just labels.** Don't just identify that a plant is shade-tolerant—explain how shade tolerance allows it to persist under the canopy while light-demanding species cannot, and what that means for forest structure over time.

**Ground every ecological principle in specific observations from your field data.** If you didn't observe evidence of a process, don't include it just because it's textbook ecology.

**AI may be used as co-intelligence to:**
- Stress-test your explanations by proposing alternative ecological mechanisms
- Fill knowledge gaps about species ecology, life history, or habitat requirements
- Check whether your causal reasoning actually explains the patterns you observed
- Identify ecological concepts you might be underweighting
- Find relevant research on similar ecosystems or species

**Unproductive AI uses** (do not do these):
- Asking AI to analyze your field notes and generate ecological interpretation
- Having AI identify which ecological concepts apply without your own reasoning
- Using AI to suggest interactions or patterns you didn't document
- Asking AI to explain ecosystem function without reference to your specific observations

**Deliverable**: 4-5 pages of ecological analysis connecting your field observations to ecological theory, with specific evidence from your documented data supporting each claim

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why allow AI as co-intelligence here?**
Students have now documented real ecosystem patterns through direct observation. AI can help them think more rigorously about the ecological processes explaining those patterns—proposing alternative mechanisms, surfacing species biology they might not know, or identifying research on similar systems. This is when AI functions as a scientific thinking partner.

**What's the boundary?**
Students must form their own ecological interpretation based on their field data before engaging AI. They can't input their field notes and ask "explain this ecosystem's ecology." That bypasses the interpretive work. Instead, students develop hypotheses about why they saw certain patterns, then use AI to test those hypotheses: "I think this understory pattern results from differential shade tolerance, but what other mechanisms could explain it?"

**What would break?**
If students skip forming their own ecological reasoning and go straight to AI, they get generic ecosystem descriptions that could apply to any similar habitat. The insight that comes from *their specific observations*—the particular species assemblage, the unusual interaction, the unexpected pattern—gets lost. AI is good at ecological pattern-matching, but it can't know what was ecologically meaningful about what *they* witnessed unless they've articulated that first.

**Student outcomes**:
Students report that AI helps them see ecological processes they were underweighting or consider alternative explanations for observed patterns. The best uses are when students have AI challenge their interpretation—"convince me this isn't about competition for light"—which forces them to either gather stronger evidence or recognize that multiple ecological processes could explain what they saw.

**Disciplinary connection**:
Ecological research involves proposing mechanisms, testing alternative hypotheses, and evaluating evidence. Learning to use AI as a "skeptical ecologist" who questions your interpretations prepares students for scientific discourse where explanations must withstand scrutiny from peer reviewers and colleagues.

### Stage 3 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 3: Management Recommendations and Conservation Application | 🤝 AI as Co-Intelligence

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Develop evidence-based recommendations for ecosystem management, restoration, or conservation** based on your ecological understanding from Stages 1 and 2.

Your recommendations should:
- Address realistic management goals (biodiversity conservation, invasive species control, habitat restoration, climate adaptation, recreation/education balance)
- Account for practical constraints (budget, maintenance, public access, property ownership, regulatory requirements)
- Recognize ecological complexity and uncertainty—management actions have cascading effects
- Propose monitoring to evaluate whether interventions achieve intended outcomes

**This is not about "fixing nature" but working with ecological processes.** Strong recommendations leverage existing ecosystem functions rather than fighting them. For example, if succession is restoring native species, the recommendation might be removing barriers to that process rather than intensive planting.

**Avoid generic advice.** Don't recommend "increase biodiversity" or "remove invasives" without specific, actionable details grounded in your site's ecology.

**AI may be used to:**
- Identify management strategies used in similar ecosystems
- Evaluate feasibility and costs of proposed interventions
- Surface unintended consequences you might not have considered
- Refine implementation details and monitoring protocols

**Deliverable**: 2-3 pages of site-specific management recommendations with ecological justification, practical implementation details, and proposed monitoring approaches

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why this stage matters**:
Students must demonstrate that ecological understanding leads to informed action. It's not enough to explain ecosystem function—they need to show how that understanding guides management decisions. This is where observation and analysis become applied ecology.

**AI's role**:
Students can use AI similarly to Stage 2—testing whether their recommendations actually address the ecological dynamics they identified, considering implementation challenges, or finding examples of similar management approaches. AI can help refine practical details without replacing the core ecological reasoning.

**What would break?**
If students ask AI "how should this ecosystem be managed?" without doing the observational and analytical work first, they get generic conservation recommendations disconnected from what they actually learned about this specific site. The power comes from recommendations grounded in their documented observations and ecological analysis.

**Student outcomes**:
Students report this is where ecology becomes tangible—they see how the species they struggled to identify and the patterns they documented have real implications for land management decisions. The constraint of recommending for their specific site (not ecosystems in general) forces practical thinking about implementation.

**Disciplinary connection**:
Applied ecologists and conservation practitioners must translate ecological knowledge into actionable management strategies. Learning to develop site-specific, evidence-based recommendations prepares students for careers where ecological understanding must inform real-world decisions about land use, restoration, and conservation.

---

### Metacognitive Component

**Header**: Co-Intelligence Appendix (Required)

**Student Instructions**:
At the end of your report, include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) addressing:

**Where did AI help you think more rigorously about ecological processes or management approaches, and where did it lack the site-specific knowledge or ecological nuance that came from your direct field observations?**

This reflection is evaluated as part of your scientific metacognition.

---

### Visual Component

**Header**: Site Map and Visual Data Summary (Optional but Recommended)

**Student Instructions**:
Create a visual synthesis of your field study using tools like Google Gemini or hand-drawn maps enhanced with AI tools. Effective visuals might include:
- Annotated site map showing species distributions, microhabitats, and key ecological features
- Visual representation of observed interactions and trophic relationships
- Time-series showing ecosystem changes across your observation period
- Before/after visualization of proposed management interventions

Include:
- The visual itself
- Brief description of what it communicates about your ecosystem analysis
- If AI-generated, include your prompt and explain how you guided the visual creation

## STUDIO ART TAB

### Assignment Overview Panel

**Course**: Studio Art: Drawing, Painting, Printmaking, or 2D Foundations

**Level**: Undergraduate, 200-300 level

**What students create**: An original artwork developed through sustained studio practice, accompanied by critical analysis using art historical frameworks and an artist statement communicating intent to public audiences.

**Why this assignment matters**: Students learn to distinguish between the embodied thinking that happens through making and the conceptual frameworks used to contextualize that work. By creating art before analyzing it through theory, they develop authentic artistic practice—discovering ideas through process rather than illustrating predetermined concepts.

---

### Stage 1 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 1: Studio Practice and Process Documentation | 🚫 No AI Permitted

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Create an original artwork** using the medium and techniques we've been exploring in class. Your work should emerge from sustained studio practice—not a single sitting, but multiple work sessions where you observe, respond, revise, and discover through making.

**Document your studio process:**
- **Initial explorations**: Sketches, tests, experiments with materials or approaches (photograph these)
- **Key decisions**: What formal choices did you make and why? Color, composition, mark-making, scale, materials
- **Technical challenges**: Where did the medium resist or surprise you? How did you respond?
- **Revisions and pivots**: What changed as the work developed? What didn't work and why?
- **The moment it became clear**: When did you know what the work needed to be? What shifted?

**This must document your actual studio thinking—not a cleaned-up narrative written afterward.** Take photos throughout the process. Keep notes during and immediately after work sessions while you remember what you were wrestling with.

**AI tools may not be used to:**
- Generate images or visual elements that become part of your artwork
- "Improve" or "enhance" your drawings, paintings, or designs
- Suggest compositions, color palettes, or formal solutions
- Reconstruct or invent studio process you didn't actually experience
- Create preliminary sketches or studies

**Why these constraints?** Art-making is a form of embodied research. Ideas emerge through the physical act of drawing, mixing color, layering marks—not through description or intention. AI can't do this thinking for you because it doesn't have hands, doesn't feel material resistance, doesn't discover through making.

**Deliverable**:
- One completed original artwork
- Process documentation (10-15 images showing development)
- Studio journal entries (2-3 pages) capturing your thinking throughout

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why no AI here?**
Studio practice is where artistic thinking happens—through material exploration, technical problem-solving, and the iterative process of making, observing, and revising. This cannot be outsourced to AI because the knowledge being built is embodied and material. A painter learns about color relationships by mixing and observing paint, not by asking AI for color theory. The constraint protects the authenticity of studio learning.

**What would break?**
If students use AI to generate preliminary images, suggest compositions, or "enhance" their work, they bypass the creative problem-solving that is the point of studio education. Art students aren't learning to make objects that look good—they're learning to think through materials, discovering ideas that only emerge through sustained engagement with a medium. AI shortcuts erase that discovery process.

**What surprises emerged?**
Some students initially see AI image generation as "just another tool like Photoshop." But studio instructors report that students who use AI for preliminary visualization never develop the same facility with material thinking. Students who struggle through 20 compositional sketches learn something students who generate 20 AI variations do not: how to see possibility in material reality rather than digital simulation.

**Addressing the complexity**:
Yes, artists use technology. But there's a crucial difference between using software to realize an idea you've developed through studio practice (like a photographer using Lightroom) versus using AI to generate the ideas themselves. This assignment protects the making-as-thinking that happens in Stage 1, while allowing digital tools for communication in Stage 3.

**Disciplinary connection**:
Professional artists develop a studio practice—a disciplined, iterative process of making and reflecting. Art school teaches this practice, not just technical skills. Students must learn that artistic ideas come through sustained engagement with materials, not inspiration or ideation divorced from making.

---

### Stage 2 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 2: Critical Contextualization Using Art Theory | 🤝 AI as Co-Intelligence

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Analyze your completed work using art historical and critical frameworks.** The goal is to situate your piece within larger conversations about how visual art creates meaning, references traditions, or engages contemporary questions.

Your analysis might explore:
- Formal strategies and their effects (how composition, color, mark-making, or scale create meaning)
- Relationship to art historical precedents or movements
- How the work engages with contemporary artistic conversations
- Theoretical frameworks that illuminate what the work does (semiotics, phenomenology, feminist theory, postcolonial critique, etc.)

**Strong analysis explains how your artistic choices function, not just what they are.** Don't just note that you used high contrast—explain how that contrast creates visual tension that relates to your conceptual concerns.

**Ground your analysis in the specific work you made.** Don't write generic theory that could apply to any artwork—connect ideas directly to observable features of your piece.

**AI may be used as co-intelligence to:**
- Explore art historical context and identify relevant precedents
- Test whether your formal analysis actually explains how the work functions
- Surface theoretical frameworks that might illuminate aspects of your work
- Find contemporary artists working with similar strategies or concerns
- Refine the precision of your critical language

**Unproductive AI uses** (do not do these):
- Asking AI to analyze your artwork from an image
- Having AI select which theoretical frameworks apply
- Using AI to generate interpretations without your own close looking
- Asking AI to explain your artistic intent (you made it—you know your intent)

**Deliverable**: 3-4 pages of critical analysis connecting your artwork to art historical context and theoretical frameworks, grounded in specific formal analysis of what you made

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why allow AI as co-intelligence here?**
Students have now created original work through studio practice. AI can help them research art historical context, explore theoretical frameworks, and refine their critical language—supporting the intellectual work of contextualizing their practice without replacing the artistic judgment that comes from making the work themselves.

**What's the boundary?**
Students must form their own analysis through close observation of their work before engaging AI. They can't upload an image and ask "analyze this artwork." That bypasses the critical looking. Instead, students develop an interpretation based on what they made and why, then use AI to deepen context: "I'm interested in how repetitive mark-making creates visual rhythm—who are artists working with similar formal strategies?"

**What would break?**
If students skip their own formal analysis and ask AI to interpret their work, they get generic art criticism disconnected from what they actually discovered through making. The insight comes from connecting their studio discoveries to larger artistic conversations—but they have to articulate what they discovered first.

**Student outcomes**:
Students report that AI helps them find relevant art historical connections they didn't know existed and introduces theoretical frameworks that illuminate aspects of their work they understood intuitively but couldn't articulate. The best uses are when students already know what their work does formally and use AI to situate that within broader contexts.

**Disciplinary connection**:
Artists must be able to contextualize their practice—understanding how their work relates to art history and contemporary discourse. Gallery talks, artist statements, and grant applications all require this ability. Learning to research context and articulate formal strategies is essential professional skill, and AI can accelerate that research while students maintain authorship of the critical insights.

---

### Stage 3 Accordion

**Header bar**: Stage 3: Artist Statement and Public Communication | 🛠️ AI as Communication Tool

**LEFT PANEL: Student Instructions**

**Write an artist statement** communicating your work to public audiences—gallery visitors, grant reviewers, or exhibition organizers who need to understand your practice and intent.

Strong artist statements:
- Explain your artistic concerns and conceptual interests (what questions does your work explore?)
- Describe your process and approach to materials
- Contextualize the work without over-explaining it (leave room for viewer interpretation)
- Use clear language accessible to educated non-specialists
- Avoid clichés ("I've always been passionate about art") and vague claims ("my work explores the human condition")

**Artist statements are a distinct genre with specific conventions.** They're not academic analysis (Stage 2) but professional communication that helps audiences engage with your work thoughtfully.

**AI may be used here as a communication tool to:**
- Refine clarity and concision (artist statements should be 250-350 words)
- Test whether your statement is accessible to non-specialist readers
- Identify jargon or unclear phrasing
- Explore different ways to articulate the same ideas
- Generate multiple phrasings of key concepts for you to choose among

**The core content—your artistic intent, your process, your concerns—must be your own.** AI helps with expression and clarity, not with determining what you have to say about your work.

**Deliverable**: Artist statement (250-350 words) suitable for exhibition or portfolio submission

---

**RIGHT PANEL: Pedagogical Reasoning**

**Why allow AI as communication tool here?**
Artist statements are professional documents where clarity and concision matter. Many artists struggle with this genre—visual thinkers articulating in words, balancing accessibility with intellectual substance. AI can help refine language and test clarity without replacing the core content, which comes from the student's studio practice and critical analysis.

**What's the boundary?**
Students must know what they want to say about their work (from Stage 2 analysis and Stage 1 process) before using AI to refine how they say it. They can't ask AI "write an artist statement for my work." Instead, they draft their own statement, then use AI to test clarity: "Does this make sense to someone unfamiliar with art theory? Is this sentence too jargon-heavy?"

**Why this is different from Stage 1**:
Stage 1 protected the making—the embodied, material thinking that can't be outsourced. Stage 3 is about professional communication, where the thinking is done and AI serves as an editing partner. The artwork exists. The analysis is complete. Now AI helps communicate that work effectively to audiences.

**Student outcomes**:
Students report relief that AI can help with the writing task they find most daunting while maintaining authenticity about their work. The constraint of drafting first ensures the statement reflects their actual practice and concerns rather than AI-generated generic artist rhetoric.

**Disciplinary connection**:
Professional artists must write statements for exhibitions, grants, residency applications, and portfolio reviews. Learning to articulate practice clearly is essential, and many successful artists work with editors or writing consultants. AI functions similarly—as a communication partner, not an artistic collaborator.

---

### Metacognitive Component

**Header**: Process Reflection (Required)

**Student Instructions**:
Include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) at the end of your written work:

**Where did the physical act of making reveal ideas or solutions you couldn't have accessed through planning or ideation alone? How did working with actual materials change your thinking about the piece?**

This reflection ensures you're consciously recognizing the difference between thinking-through-making and thinking-about-making.

---

### Visual Component

**Header**: Process Video or Documentation (Optional but Recommended)

**Student Instructions**:
Create a brief (1-2 minute) video or visual sequence documenting your studio process. This might include:
- Time-lapse of the work developing
- Key decision points with before/after images
- Close-ups showing material handling or technique
- Narration explaining pivotal moments in the process

You may use AI tools to:
- Edit and sequence video or images
- Generate captions or text overlays
- Enhance documentation quality (lighting, clarity)

You may NOT use AI to:
- Generate process documentation you didn't actually capture
- Create "making-of" content for stages you didn't document
- Simulate studio work that didn't happen

**If you include process documentation, also include:**
- Brief description of what the documentation reveals about your practice
- If AI tools were used for editing/presentation, note which ones and how

## END OF CONTENT DOCUMENT

**This completes all four discipline tabs with full detail for all stages, pedagogical reasoning, metacognitive components, and visual synthesis options. Ready for you to review before I begin building the application.**
